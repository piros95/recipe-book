Serves: 2

## Ingredients

- 1 cup self-rising flour 
- 1/2 cup Greek Yogurt, non-fat, full-fat or reduced fat
- Pinch of salt
- 1/2 tablespoon butter

## Directions

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine your flour, salt (if using it) and Greek yogurt. Mix well, until combined. Then, use your hands to form a large ball of dough.
2. Lightly flour a wooden or kitchen surface. Sprinkle a little extra flour on top of the ball of dough, before transferring it to the floured surface. Flatten into a circular shape and divide into 8 even portions. Flatten each portion into a rectangular shape (like a classic Naan bread).
3. Knead dough for 5-8 minutes until window pane is achieved
4. Heat a non-stick saucepan on medium heat. When hot, place flattened dough and cook for 3 minutes, before flipping and cooking a further 2 minutes. Repeat until all the naan bread is cooked.
5. Once cooked, if desired, lightly brush the tops of each naan bread with melted garlic butter.
