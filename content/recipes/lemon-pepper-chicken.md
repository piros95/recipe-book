Serves: 2

## Ingredients

- 2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch cubes
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon pepper
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic, minced
- 1 1/2 teaspoons paprika

## For the seasoned butter
- 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, melted
- 1/2 teaspoon paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon lemon pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon freshly chopped parsley

## Directions

1. In a large bowl, combine the cubed chicken breasts, oil, paprika, salt, lemon juice, pepper, garlic, and paprika. Toss to coat the chicken evenly.
2. Thread the chicken cubes onto the soaked wooden skewers.
3. Add the skewers to the basket of your air fryer in a single layer. (Depending on the size of the air fryer, you may have to work in batches.) Air fry* at 400°F for 11-12 minutes, flipping halfway. Chicken is fully cooked when it reaches an internal temperature of 165°F. While the chicken is cooking, make the seasoned butter.
4. Serve with rice and/or naan bread.

**Seasoned butter**

1. In a small bowl, mix the melted butter with paprika, lemon pepper, garlic, parika, and chopped parsley.
2. Brush the seasoned butter over the cooked chicken skewers. Serve immediately.
