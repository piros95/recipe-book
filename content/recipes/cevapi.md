Serves: 18 sausages

## Ingredients

- 1 lbs beef mince
- 4 cloves garlic
- 1/2 bunch parsley finely chopped
- 1/4 cup cold water
- 1 teaspoon sweet paprika
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 tablespoon olive oil

## Directions

1. Place the beef mince in a large mixing bowl along with the garlic, parsley, sweet paprika, salt and pepper. Mix by hand until roughly combined.
2. Next grab a small dish and mix the cold water and baking soda together until it dissolves a little bit (it won't dissolve entirely, this is fine).
3. Add the baking soda mixture into the meat mix and massage together for a good 5 minutes until it's all combined. Tip: This process is essential to help emulsify the mixture and give it the smooth, springy texture!
4. Take a small handful of the mixture and first roll it into a ball, then into a small sausage shape. Pat each end to flatten and pop it on the plate. The length should be around the width of your hand.
5. Heat the vegetable oil a large cast iron skillet or frying pan on medium heat. Cook the cevapi for a few minutes per side until browned. Tip: Slice one in half to test if they're cooked in the middle. A slight pink is okay for beef sausages.
6. Once cooked, I recommend serving hot with rice, fries and/or fresh pita bread (you can use the naan recipe), chopped raw onion and ajvar* spread.

*Ajvar is a condiment that originally comes from – and is still popular in – the Balkan region. There are a few variations, but the most common version is red in color from the inclusion of red bell peppers and eggplant. It's a versatile spread for bread and a dip for vegetables and meats!
