Serves: 2

## Ingredients 

- 3.5 oz udon noodles
- 3 cups water
- Salt
- Sesame seeds to garnish
- 1/4 cup green onions chopped

## Ingredients for the sauce

- 3 tablespoons peanut butter (smooth or crunchy)
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon vinegar
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon maple syrup or honey
- 1/2 teaspoon red chili flakes
- Salt
- Pepper
  
## Directions

1. Heat water in a large saucepan. Add salt. Once it starts to boil, add noodles. Give it a quick stir and boil for 9-12 minutes (or as instructed in the packaging).
2. Once it's boiled, turn off the heat and drain. Drizzle a bit of olive oil and gently mix using 2 forks. This prevents the noodles from sticking (and drying out) while we're preparing the rest of the ingredients.
3. In a mixing bowl, add all the peanut sauce ingredients. Stir and mix until smooth. If you're using crunchy peanut butter you might have to stir it vigorously. Set aside.
4. Add the boiled noodles. Gently fold and mix until the noodles are completely coated with the sauce.
5. Garnish with green onions and sesame seeds. Serve hot (or cold, but you know my opinion on that).
