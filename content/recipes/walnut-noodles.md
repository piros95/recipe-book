Serves: 4

## Ingredients

- 3/4 lbs dried pasta, ideally a long and thin variety called 'met√©lt' to which tagliolini or tagliatelle come closest 
- 2 cup finely ground walnuts
- 8 tbsp (1/2 cup) powdered sugar
- 5 tbsp butter
- Pinch of salt, for the pasta water
- Runny apricot preserves

## Directions

1. In a medium pot, bring 2.1 quarts salted water to a boil and cook pasta until al dente, about 7-8 minutes. Drain pasta, then add to a large pan or pot and toss with butter so that pasta becomes slippery on all sides.
2. In the meantime, mix together freshly ground walnuts and powdered sugar in a medium bowl.
3. Pour the walnut mixture onto the pasta and mix well so that all strands are nicely coated. Spoon individual portions into serving plates and serve while hot with a topping of runny apricot jam.

**Notes**

Given the simplicity of the noodle toppings here, it pays off to use a generous hand with both the walnut mixture and the fruit preserves and be sure to serve fresh off the stove (so NOT COLD).
