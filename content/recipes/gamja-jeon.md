Serves: 2

## Ingredients

- 2 russet potato
- Salt
- 2 tablespoon granulated sugar, add more depending on taste
- 1/2 cup cornstarch 
- Mozzarella cheese (small cubes or shredded)
- Oil with a high smoke point for shallow frying

## For dipping sauce
- 2 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lime juice (or vinegar)
- 1 green onion, chopped
- 1/4 cup thinly sliced onion
- 1 jalapeno pepper, chopped
- 1/2 teaspoon sugar

## Directions

1. Prepare a large pot of boiling water and salt it well.
2. Peel and dice your potatoes into 1 inch cubes, then boil for about 12 minutes until soft and able to be easily pierced with a fork.  Drain the water and let it sit back in the pot for 30 seconds to help remove more water, then transfer to a mixing bowl.
3. Add the sugar and cornstarch, then mix well.  It should have a similar consistency to dense mashed potatoes with few lumps.
4. Separate the potato mix into fifths and roll each piece into balls.  Flatten each ball, then add a small handful of cheese (10g) and close it so the cheese stays in the middle.  Roll it into a ball again and flatten it, then roll the edges with your hands to give it a smoother shape.
5. Add a generous amount of oil to a pan so that it covers the pan entirely.  When the oil is hot enough, add the potatoes and cook on medium high for about 4 to 5 minutes on each side.  It is ready to be flipped when it turns golden brown.
