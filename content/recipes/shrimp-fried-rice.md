Serves: 2

## Ingredients

- 1/2 lb large shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper
- 1 1/2 tablespoon oil
- 1/2 small onion, diced
- 2 green scallions, thinly sliced (white and green parts separated)
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1/2 teaspoon minced ginger
- 1 cup frozen peas and carrots, thawed
- 2 large eggs, beaten
- 2 cups cooked white rice
- 1 1/2 tablespoon soy sauce
- 2 teaspoon sesame seeds

## Directions

1. Season the shrimp. In a medium bowl, season the shrimp with the salt and pepper. Set aside.
2. Sear the shrimp. Heat 2 tablespoon of avocado oil in a large wok or skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the shrimp in a single layer and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, then flip and cook another 30 seconds, until just cooked through and opaque. Remove to a plate.
3. Add the aromatics. Add the onion, white parts of the green onion, garlic, and ginger, and stir-fry for a minute, until fragrant.
4. Cook the veggies. Add the frozen carrots and peas (no need to thaw), and stir-fry for 1 to 2 minutes until warmed through.
5. Cook the eggs. Move the veggies to the side, then add the beaten eggs and quickly scramble them until they're pillowy soft.
6. Stir-fry the rice, seasoning, and shrimp. Add the rice, shrimp, soy sauce, and sesame oil, and stir-fry until the rice and shrimp are warmed through, about 2 minutes.
7. Garnish with green onions. Stir in the green parts of the green onions before serving.
