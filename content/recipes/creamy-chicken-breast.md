Serves: 2

## Ingredients

- 2 chicken breasts
- 3 tablespoons butter, divided
- 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper, or to taste
- 1 teaspoon oregano
- 1 medium onion, minced
- 1 small jar sun-dried tomatoes, drained from oil and chopped
- 1/2 cup chicken broth
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 1/3 cup grated parmesan or mozzarella cheese (I prefer mozzarella)
- 1 cup spinach (or more if you like)

## Directions

1. First, season chicken breasts with salt, pepper, and oregano. Cook chicken in a large skillet for 4 minutes on each side until browned. Transfer chicken breasts to a plate and set aside.
2. To make the cream sauce, add butter to the same pan and cook onion, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon oregano, and sun-dried tomatoes. Add chicken broth, heavy cream, and Parmesan cheese and simmer for 2-3 minutes.
3. Add spinach to the mixture and cook until wilted. Add the chicken breasts back to the pan and reheat for 2-3 minutes.
4. Serve over rice.
