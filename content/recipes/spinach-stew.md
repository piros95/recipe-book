Serves: 4

## Ingredients

- 2 1/4 lbs spinach, tough stems removed, leaves carefully cleaned of dirt by immersing them in a large bowl with two changes of cold water
- 4 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, peeled and finely chopped (make it 3 if you're a garlic fan)
- 1 teaspoon salt (more to taste)
- 1 bread roll, soaked in milk and squeezed dry
- 1/2 cup light cream
- 2 egg yolks, whipped
- Slices of crusty bread or boiled potatoes for the side

## Directions

1. Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high, then add thoroughly cleaned spinach and sauté until it has wilted and released most of its water, about 6-8 minutes (you’ll likely have to add spinach in batches as the pot initially doesn’t fit them all, but the spinach will quickly lose most of its volume).
2. Turn off heat. Add salt, pepper, chopped garlic, soaked bread roll, and using an immersion blender, purée the stew until smooth.
3. Immediately after this, while stew is still hot, add light cream and the whipped egg yolks and stir vigorously for 1 minute. Yolks will help thicken the stew (be sure that the heat is off else the egg yolks will start to coagulate).
4. Taste for salt and add more if needed. Serve the spinach stew in shallow bowls with a topping of fried or soft-boiled or poached egg and crusty bread or boiled potatoes on the side.
