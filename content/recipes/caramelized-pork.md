Serves: 4

## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 tablespoon cooking oil
- 1/2 onion, finely diced (brown, white or yellow)
- 2 teaspoon ginger, grated or minced
- 2 garlic cloves, minced (2 tsp paste)
- 1 birds eye or Thai chili, deseeded and finely chopped (optional)
- 1 lb ground pork (mince)
- 5 tablespoon brown sugar
- 2 tablespoon fish sauce or soy sauce

## Serving
- 1 green onion stem , finely sliced
- Rice or vermicelli noodles
- Sliced red chilli, tomato, cucumber (optional)

## Directions

1. Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat.
2. Add the onion, ginger, garlic and chili and cook for 2 minutes.
3. Add the pork mince and cook for 2 minutes or so until white all over, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon.
4. Add the sugar and fish or soy sauce. Stir, then leave it to cook without touching until all the juices cook out and the pork starts caramelised â€“ about 2 minutes. Then stir it and leave it again, without stirring, for around 30 seconds to get more caramelisation. Repeat twice more until caramelised to your taste.
5. Serve over rice or vermicelli noodles, garnished with sliced scallions/shallots.
